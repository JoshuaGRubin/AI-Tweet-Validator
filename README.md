# Did I write this?  
Fraudulent posts on social media are embarrassing to individuals and expensive to brands.  Language embedding models offer a means to characterize typical activity for a user and can be applied in a simple binary discriminator to screen incoming content.

This repository provides a demonstration of the use of language embedding (via [Universal Sentence Encoder](https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder/2)) to classify new Twitter posts as in or out-of-character for a particular user.  In a production system (implemented on the platform side), a user could be presented with secondary authentication to validate activity for the occasional false positive.

## Setup

The reccomended way to run this project is by installing Docker and building and running an image.  This maximizes stability and portibility.  It also manages environment variables nicely. 


- First, visit https://www.docker.com to install the Docker platform (e.g. Docker Desktop) on your machine.

- *Optional*: while data from 13 Twitter users in included in the `data/raw` directory, if you'd like to be able to retrieve your own (e.g. more/other users, more recent tweets), you'll need to set up a Twitter developer account and app.  To do so, please visit https://developer.twitter.com, create an app, and have it approved.  Once this is complete, you'll have access to API keys.  To enable API access in this package, please uncomment the appropriate four rows in `build\Dockerfile` and paste in your credientials.

- To build and run your container, run the following in your command shell.

```bash
cd <project directory>
./build_docker
./run_docker
```

## Motivation for this project format:
- **Insight_Project_Framework** : Put all source code for production within structured directory
- **tests** : Put all source code for testing in an easy to find location
- **configs** : Enable modification of all preset variables within single directory (consisting of one or many config files for separate tasks)
- **data** : Include example a small amount of data in the Github repository so tests can be run to validate installation
- **build** : Include scripts that automate building of a standalone environment
- **static** : Any images or content to include in the README or web framework if part of the pipeline

## Setup
Clone repository and update python path
```
repo_name=Insight_Project_Framework # URL of your new repository
username=mrubash1 # Username for your personal github account
git clone https://github.com/$username/$repo_name
cd $repo_name
echo "export $repo_name=${PWD}" >> ~/.bash_profile
echo "export PYTHONPATH=$repo_name/src:${PYTHONPATH}" >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```
Create new development branch and switch onto it
```
branch_name=dev-readme_requisites-20180905 # Name of development branch, of the form 'dev-feature_name-date_of_creation'}}
git checkout -b $branch_name
```

## Initial Commit
Lets start with a blank slate: remove `.git` and re initialize the repo
```
cd $repo_name
rm -rf .git   
git init   
git status
```  
You'll see a list of file, these are files that git doesn't recognize. At this point, feel free to change the directory names to match your project. i.e. change the parent directory Insight_Project_Framework and the project directory Insight_Project_Framework:
Now commit these:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin $branch_name
```

## Requisites

- List all packages and software needed to build the environment
- This could include cloud command line tools (i.e. gsutil), package managers (i.e. conda), etc.

#### Dependencies

- [Streamlit](streamlit.io)

#### Installation
To install the package above, pleae run:
```shell
pip install -r requiremnts
```

## Build Environment
- Include instructions of how to launch scripts in the build subfolder
- Build scripts can include shell scripts or python setup.py files
- The purpose of these scripts is to build a standalone environment, for running the code in this repository
- The environment can be for local use, or for use in a cloud environment
- If using for a cloud environment, commands could include CLI tools from a cloud provider (i.e. gsutil from Google Cloud Platform)
```
# Example

# Step 1
# Step 2
```

## Configs
- We recommond using either .yaml or .txt for your config files, not .json
- **DO NOT STORE CREDENTIALS IN THE CONFIG DIRECTORY!!**
- If credentials are needed, use environment variables or HashiCorp's [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/)


## Test
- Include instructions for how to run all tests after the software is installed
```
# Example

# Step 1
# Step 2
```

## Run Inference
- Include instructions on how to run inference
- i.e. image classification on a single image for a CNN deep learning project
```
# Example

# Step 1
# Step 2
```

## Build Model
- Include instructions of how to build the model
- This can be done either locally or on the cloud
```
# Example

# Step 1
# Step 2
```

## Serve Model
- Include instructions of how to set up a REST or RPC endpoint
- This is for running remote inference via a custom model
```
# Example

# Step 1
# Step 2
```

## Analysis
- Include some form of EDA (exploratory data analysis)
- And/or include benchmarking of the model and results
```
# Example

# Step 1
# Step 2
```
